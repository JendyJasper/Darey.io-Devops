# AWS CLOUD SOLUTION FOR 2 COMPANY WEBSITES USING A REVERSE PROXY TECHNOLOGY

You will build a secure infrastructure inside AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) network for a fictitious company
that uses WordPress CMS for its main business website, and a Tooling Website (https://github.com/<your-name>/tooling) 
for their DevOps team. As part of the company’s desire for improved security and performance, a decision has been made 
to use a reverse proxy technology from NGINX to achieve this.

> Cost, Security, and Scalability are the major requirements for this project. Hence, implementing the architecture designed below, 
ensure that infrastructure for both websites, WordPress and Tooling, is resilient to Web Server’s failures, can accommodate to 
increased traffic and, at the same time, has reasonable cost.
