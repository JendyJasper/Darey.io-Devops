# MIGRATION TO THE СLOUD WITH CONTAINERIZATION. PART 1 – DOCKER & DOCKER COMPOSE
> what is Docker? Docker is a platform designed to help developers build, share, and run container applications. Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container.

**Install Docker and prepare for migration to the Cloud**
First, we need to install Docker Engine, which is a client-server application that contains:
  -  A server with a long-running daemon process dockerd.
  -  APIs that specify interfaces that programs can use to talk to and instruct the Docker daemon.
  -  A command-line interface (CLI) client docker.
