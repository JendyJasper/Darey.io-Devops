## IMPLEMENT A CLIENT SERVER ARCHITECTURE USING MYSQL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (DBMS)
- create two ec2 instances and configure them, name one "mysql server" and the other one "mysql client"
- log in to both instances, and run ```sudo apt update``` and ```sudo apt upgrade```
- on the mysql server ec2 instance, run ```sudo apt install mysql-server``` to install the mysql server software
- on the mysql client ec2 instance, run ```sudo apt install mysql-client``` to install the mysql client software
- go to your mysql server ec2 instance security group and edit the inbound rule to allow mysql connection from mysql client ec2 instance. Because they are both in the same local netowk, use the private address of the mysql client as the only allowed IP address to connect using mysql to the mysql server ec2 instance. Mysql uses port 3306

- the mysql server is set up by default to accept mysql connections only from the local machine. You need to change this to enable it allow connections from remote hosts. run the command ```sudo vi /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf``` and replace the localhost address of 127.0.0.1 to 0.0.0.0 which means any address

- on the mysql server, create mysql database, a user, password and some neccessary configurations before attempting to connect to it from the mysql client
- login to the mysql software on the mysql server: ```sudo mysql```
- run this command to create a user: ```mysql> CREATE USER 'jendy_jasper'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';```. The % symbol means any address can connect to it
- Create database: ```CREATE DATABASE test_db;```
- grant privileges: ```GRANT ALL ON test_db.* TO 'jendy_jasper'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;```
- flush privileges: ```FLUSH PRIVILEGES;```
- exit the mysql shell: ```exit```

- restart mysql: ```sudo systemctl restart mysql```
- login to the mysql client ec2 instance and connect to the mysql server ec2 instance via mysql: ```sudo mysql -u jendy_jasper -h 172.31.51.248 -p``` and hit enter. a password prompt comes up. Enter the password and you should be connected as shown below:

- run ```SHOW DATABASES```. If you can see the test_db database created earlier, it means you are successfully connected. Refer to the screenshot below:

- create a table. Firs, select the database you want to use: ```USE test_db```
- run the command to create a table and specify the schema for the colunms: ```CREATE TABLE movies(title VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,genre VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,director VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL,release_year INT NOT NULL,PRIMARY KEY(title));```
- run ```DESCRIBE movies``` to make sure the table was created
