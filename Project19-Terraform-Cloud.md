# What Terraform Cloud is and why use it

Terraform is an open-source system, that you install and run a Virtual Machine (VM) that you have to create, maintain and keep up to date. In the Cloud world it is quite common to provide a managed version of an open-source software. Managed means that you do not have to install, configure and maintain it yourself – you just create an account and use it “as A Service”.

Terraform Cloud is a managed service that provides you with Terraform CLI to provision infrastructure, either on demand or in response to various events.

By default, Terraform CLI performs operation on the server where it is invoked, it is perfectly fine if you have a dedicated role who can launch it, but if you have a team who works with Terraform – you need a consistent remote environment with remote workflow and shared state to run Terraform commands.

Terraform Cloud executes Terraform commands on disposable virtual machines, this remote execution is also called remote operations.
