# What Terraform Cloud is and why use it

Terraform is an open-source system, that you installed and ran a Virtual Machine (VM) that you had to create, maintain and keep up to date. In Cloud world it is quite common to provide a managed version of an open-source software. Managed means that you do not have to install, configure and maintain it yourself – you just create an account and use it “as A Service”.

Terraform Cloud is a managed service that provides you with Terraform CLI to provision infrastructure, either on demand or in response to various events.
